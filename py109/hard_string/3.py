# 3. Abbreviation expander
# ------------------------
# You are given a string and a dictionary of abbreviations to expansions.
# Replace *whole-word* abbreviations (case-insensitive) with their full forms.
# Do NOT change words that only *contain* the abbreviation as a substring.
#
# Example:
#   mapping = {
#       "btw": "by the way",
#       "asap": "as soon as possible",
#   }
#   expand_abbr("Please reply asap, btw.", mapping)
#   -> "Please reply as soon as possible, by the way."
#
# You may assume:
# - Words are separated by spaces.
# - Punctuation like ".", ",", "!" may appear attached to the end of a word.
#
# Hint: Think about how to temporarily separate punctuation from words,
# then put it back after replacement.
def expand_abbr(text, mapping):
    pass
