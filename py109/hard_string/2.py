# 2. Normalize whitespace and punctuation
# ---------------------------------------
# Write a function that takes a sentence and:
# - Strips leading and trailing whitespace.
# - Replaces any run of 2+ spaces with a single space.
# - Ensures there is exactly ONE space after each comma, and no space before it.
# - Makes no other changes to the text.
#
# Example:
#   normalize_text("  Hello ,  world  ,this  is,  Python ")
#   -> "Hello, world, this is, Python"
#
# Hint: combine methods like `strip`, `replace`, `split`, and careful rebuilding.
def normalize_text(text):
    pass
